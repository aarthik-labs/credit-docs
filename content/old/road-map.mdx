Near-term additions aligned with the current architecture:

* Domain namespaces (illustrative): `offers`, `applications`, `journeys`, `events`, `theme`, `session`
* React UI components:

  * embeddable journey container
  * status + outcome screens
  * retry/error UI patterns
* Journey persistence adapters:

  * `localStorage` + `IndexedDB` (web)
  * pluggable storage interface for mobile + server
* Event normalization:

  * polling fallback
  * optional SSE/WebSocket support (where applicable)

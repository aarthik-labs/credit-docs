## Journey persistence and resume (draft)

Journeys are designed to be resilient to:

* page refresh
* app background/foreground transitions
* network drops
* user returning later

**Planned integration surface:**

* pluggable storage adapters (web: `localStorage` / `IndexedDB`, mobile: secure storage)
* snapshot persistence (minimal durable state)
* optional event history for debugging and support

**Practical impact for clients:**

* fewer abandoned journeys due to “lost progress”
* cleaner customer support diagnostics (“what step did the user reach?”)
* easier conversion optimization (analytics at each state boundary)

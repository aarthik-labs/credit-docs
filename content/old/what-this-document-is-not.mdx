## What this document intentionally does not include

This is an SDK integration guide, so we intentionally do **not** expose:

* platform endpoint paths
* partner-specific business rules
* protocol negotiation or status semantics
* compliance workflows unique to a specific lender/provider

Your product team integrates with stable SDK capabilities; the platform mechanics remain encapsulated.

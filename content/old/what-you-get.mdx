## The Parts That Make It Whole

### 1) Headless SDK core (client + transport)

A configured client instance provides:

* **Tenant scoping** (client default, per request override, or scoped client)
* **Auth injection** (static token or dynamic token resolver)
* **Timeouts + retries** (conservative defaults; configurable)
* **Abort/cancel support** (`AbortSignal`)
* **Correlation IDs** for every request (for traceability)
* **Idempotency keys** support for safe write operations

### 2) Strong typing (TypeScript)

* SDK ships TypeScript types to reduce integration guesswork and refactor risk.
* Types are designed to be **app-friendly**: clear fields, composable structures, and consistent patterns.

### 3) Optional UI layer (React)

For teams optimizing for speed-to-market:

* Drop-in, embeddable React primitives for common credit screens and layouts
* **White-label theming** using CSS variables (container-scoped, no global CSS collisions)
* Dark mode support without requiring changes to `<html>` in the host app

### 4) Journey orchestration (workflow layer)

Credit journeys often span multiple screens, network steps, and asynchronous updates.

The SDK models this as a **journey** that:

* moves through **clear, named steps**
* accepts **user actions** and **external updates**
* exposes a **single source of truth** for “where the user is”
* can be **persisted and resumed** (crash-safe, refresh-safe)

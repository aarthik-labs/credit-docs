## Auth and security model

### Security baseline: keep secrets off the client

* Browser and mobile apps should use **short-lived / session tokens**.
* Any long-lived credentials or signing keys should live in your backend.

### Hybrid “token broker” architecture (optional)

```

* **Client SDK:** uses session/public tokens via `auth.getToken()`
* **Server SDK (optional):** performs sensitive operations or credential exchange
* This keeps your security posture clean while preserving fast UX.

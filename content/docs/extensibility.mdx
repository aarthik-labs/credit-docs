The client is designed to be extended without forking.

Typical use cases:

* custom analytics
* custom storage/persistence
* custom logging/observability
* organization-specific helpers

Illustrative pattern:

```ts
const withAnalytics = () => (client) => ({
  analytics: {
    track: (name: string, payload?: unknown) => {
      client.config.logger?.information?.("[analytics]", name, payload);
    },
  },
});

const creditWithAnalytics = credit.extend(withAnalytics());
```

## The modal/drawer doesn’t open

**Likely cause:** rendering the SDK in a Server Component (Next.js App Router).

✅ Fix:
- Move the SDK usage into a `"use client"` component.

## The UI looks unstyled / broken

**Likely causes:**
- Your app is missing shadcn/tailwind base styles (if the SDK depends on them)
- CSS variables like `--background` aren’t defined

✅ Fix:
- Ensure your design system variables exist
- See [Theming & White-label](./theming)

## The iframe is blank

**Likely causes:**
- CSP blocks `frame-src`
- Origin not allowlisted
- Token is missing/expired

✅ Fix:
- Update CSP
- Check your dashboard allowlist
- Mint a fresh Bootstrap Token and retry

## Token mint endpoint returns 401/403

**Likely causes:**
- Wrong environment key (test vs production)
- Key revoked or rotated
- Using key in the wrong header format

✅ Fix:
- Verify environment selection
- Ensure `Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>` (or the expected header)
- Rotate keys if compromised

## “Works on desktop but not on mobile”

**Likely causes:**
- WebView/Browser iframe limitations
- Fullscreen behavior not configured

✅ Fix:
- Use `fullscreen="mobile-only"`
- Test on Safari iOS and Android Chrome early

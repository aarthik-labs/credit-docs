## Iframe is blank or blocked

**Likely causes:**
- Embed domain not allow-listed in `embed_domains`
- CSP blocks `frame-ancestors` or `frame-src`

✅ Fix:
- Allow-list your domain for the application
- Update CSP to allow the platform domain in `frame-src`

## Backend returns 400 (Missing contactNumber)

**Likely cause:** `contactNumber` is empty or malformed.

✅ Fix:
- Validate and pass a non-empty `contactNumber` (E.164 format recommended)

## Backend returns 401/403 from the platform

**Likely causes:**
- Wrong API key (test vs live)
- Key revoked or rotated
- Wrong platform base URL

✅ Fix:
- Verify `PLATFORM_API_KEY` and `PLATFORM_BASE_URL`
- Rotate keys if compromised

## Embed URL expires or journey does not resume

**Likely cause:** the `embedUrl` contains a short-lived bootstrap token.

✅ Fix:
- Call your backend again to mint a fresh session and render a new `embedUrl`

## Camera or microphone not available

**Likely causes:**
- Missing iframe permissions
- Non-HTTPS origin

✅ Fix:
- Add `allow="camera; microphone; clipboard-read; clipboard-write"`
- Serve the host app over HTTPS

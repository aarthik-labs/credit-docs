## Core concepts

### Client instance

A client instance represents:

* your default configuration (base URL, auth, tenancy, reliability)
* your integration contract (stable error model, headers, hooks)
* an extension surface (plugins + domain modules)

### Tenant scoping

A tenant is the **scope boundary** for multi-customer or multi-merchant integrations (e.g., “which customer is this request for?”).

The SDK supports tenant scoping via:

1. client default (`tenant.defaultTenantID`)
2. per-call override (`tenantID` in request options)
3. scoped clients (`credit.withTenant("tenant_123")`) — recommended

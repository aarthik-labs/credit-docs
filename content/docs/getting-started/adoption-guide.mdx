## The Parts That Make It Whole

You can adopt the SDK in layers.

| Path                         | Best for                     | You build                                       | SDK provides                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Headless only**            | You already have UI patterns | All UI + state                                  | Client + typing + reliability + journey engine (headless) |
| **UI + headless**            | Fastest integration          | Minimal UI wiring                               | UI components + theming + journeys + transport            |
| **Hybrid (server-assisted)** | Strict security/compliance   | Small backend for tokens / sensitive operations | Same SDK patterns on server and client                    |

## Do I need to build any loan journey UI myself?

No. The whole point is: you embed the journey as a hosted UI inside an iframe.

## Why do you use an iframe?

Security + isolation + speed:

- isolates sensitive flows from the host app
- keeps forms/KYC flows consistent across tenants
- lets you ship updates without tenant redeploys

## Does the borrower leave my site?

No. The journey runs inside your site, inside an overlay.

## My loan journey lasts days. How does auth work?

Journeys last days. Tokens do not.

- Tokens are short-lived credentials.
- To resume, mint a new Bootstrap Token for the same journey scope.

## Can I customize the button / trigger?

Yes. Use a custom component trigger in `triggerProperties.component`.

## Can I white-label it?

Yes. The shell can inherit host theme via shadcn tokens, and the embedded checkout supports controlled theming via platform configuration.

## Do I ever need access/refresh tokens in my app?

No. Those should remain inside the iframe boundary.
Your app should rely on server-side state + webhooks (if enabled) for long-running status.

### Do we need a backend?

Not always. If your app can use browser-safe session tokens, you can integrate directly.

If you require stronger credential protection or complex security policies, use the hybrid “token broker” pattern.

### Can we use this in a multi-tenant SaaS?

Yes. Tenancy is a first-class configuration and request concept.

### Can we fully customize the UI?

Yes. Use headless journeys + your UI, or embed the UI layer and theme it with scoped CSS variables.

### Can we instrument and monitor integrations?

Yes. Correlation IDs, hooks, and a stable error taxonomy are designed specifically for production observability.

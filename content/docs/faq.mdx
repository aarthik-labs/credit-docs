## Do I need to build any loan journey UI myself?

No. The journey is hosted and rendered inside an iframe. You only build the trigger and the container UI around it.

## Why do you use an iframe?

Security, isolation, and speed:

- isolates sensitive flows from the host app
- keeps journeys consistent across tenants
- lets us ship updates without tenant redeploys

## Does the borrower leave my site?

No. The journey runs inside your app within the iframe.

## How does authentication work?

- The API key stays on your server.
- Your backend creates a session and returns an `embedUrl`.
- The `embedUrl` includes a short-lived bootstrap token that the platform consumes internally.

## My loan journey lasts days. How do I resume it?

Request a fresh session from your backend and render a new `embedUrl`. The platform will continue the journey for the same borrower.

## Can I customize the button or entry point?

Yes. You fully control the UI that triggers the session creation and renders the iframe.

## Do I ever need access/refresh tokens in my app?

No. Those tokens stay inside the iframe boundary and are managed by the platform.

title: Credit SDK
description: Embed a complete loan journey inside your app.
---

<Callout type="info" title="What this is">
The Credit SDK enables partners to embed a full loan application flow within their web or mobile application using a secure **iframe / webview**, rendered as a **Dialog** (desktop) or **Drawer** (mobile).
</Callout>

The embedded journey is fully managed by **Aarthik Labs** and runs seamlessly within the partner’s application context.

## What the SDK Provides

### 1. End-to-End Borrower Journey UI

Includes:

- Profile and basic details capture  
- Offer discovery and selection  
- Consent capture (data, KYC, lender, etc.)  
- Loan application progression and real-time status updates  

---

### 2. Single Integration Surface

- Partner backend generates a **short-lived Auth Token**  
- Partner frontend passes this token to the SDK to initialize the journey  

---

### 3. Zero UI and Journey Build on the Partner Side

Partners **do not** build or maintain:

- Forms and validations  
- KYC, mandate, and document upload screens  
- Consent flows and regulatory disclosures  
- Application status and error-handling screens  
- ONDC integrations  
- Lender-specific integrations  
- Protocol version upgrades and journey changes  

All journey orchestration, lender routing, protocol handling, and regulatory compliance are fully managed within the SDK.

---

## High-Level Flow

- Partner backend requests an **Auth Token** from Aarthik Labs Initiate APIs  
- Partner frontend initializes the Credit SDK using the token  
- SDK launches as an embedded **Dialog** (desktop) or **Drawer** (mobile)  
- Borrower completes the loan journey within the partner’s website or app  
- Real-time journey status and events are sent back to the partner via **callbacks / webhooks**

## Key concepts

### Tenant

The business integrating the Credit SDK.

### Application

A configuration boundary for a tenant (e.g., “My Web App”, “My Android WebView”), used for scoping keys, allowlists, webhooks, theming.

### Borrower

The end-user applying for credit.

### Journey

A single borrower’s loan journey instance. Journeys can last **days** (e.g., sanction/disbursal timelines).

### Tokens

* **API Key (`API_KEY`)**: Long-lived, secured, credentials for the tenant.
  **Server-only. Never goes to the browser.**
* **Bootstrap Token**: Short-lived, one-time token minted by your backend for a specific borrower + journey scope.
  This is what the frontend passes to the SDK UI.
* **Access/Refresh tokens**: Used internally by the embedded journey (inside the dialog/drawer). The host app shouldn’t touch these.

## What the SDK UI actually renders

* Desktop: **modal dialog** holding the embedded journey.
* Mobile: **full-height drawer** holding the embedded journey.

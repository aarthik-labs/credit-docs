description: Embed a complete loan journey inside your app.

<Callout type="info" title="What this is">
The Credit SDK lets you embed a **full loan application journey** inside a **secure iframe** wrapped in a **Dialog (desktop) / Drawer (mobile)** overlay.
</Callout>

## What you get

When you use the Credit SDK, you get:

- A **drop-in UI** for a borrower to discover offers, complete KYC/consents, and progress through the loan journey.
- A **single integration surface**: your backend mints a **Bootstrap Token**, your frontend passes it to the SDK UI.
- **No loan-journey UI build on your side** (you don’t build forms, validations, KYC screens, etc.).

## How it works (high level)

  TenantBE->>CreditAPI: Authenticate with SECRET_KEY (server-only)
  CreditAPI-->>TenantBE: bootstrap_token (short-lived)
  TenantBE-->>TenantFE: bootstrap_token
  TenantFE->>SDK: Render/open SDK with bootstrap_token
  SDK->>IFrame: Load embedded checkout with token

  CreditAPI-->>IFrame: access/refresh tokens"

## Key concepts

### Tenant

The business integrating the Credit SDK (your customer).

### Application

A configuration boundary for a tenant (e.g., “My Web App”, “My Android WebView”), used for scoping keys, allowlists, webhooks, theming.

### Borrower

The end-user applying for credit.

### Journey

A single borrower’s loan journey instance. Journeys can last **days** (e.g., sanction/disbursal timelines).

### Tokens

* **SECRET_KEY (API key)**: Long-lived credential for the tenant.
  **Server-only. Never goes to the browser.**
* **Bootstrap Token**: Short-lived, one-time token minted by your backend for a specific borrower + journey scope.
  This is what the frontend passes to the SDK UI.
* **Access/Refresh tokens**: Used internally by the embedded checkout (inside the iframe).
  The host app shouldn’t touch these.

## What the SDK UI actually renders

* Desktop: **modal dialog**
* Mobile: **full-height drawer**
* Inside: an **iframe** that runs the entire credit journey UI on our hosted domain

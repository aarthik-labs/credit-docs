description: Embed a complete loan journey with a single backend call and an iframe.

<Callout type="info" title="What this is">
The hosted experience lets you embed a full loan journey inside your app using a secure iframe. Your backend creates a session, your frontend renders the iframe, and the platform handles tokens and refresh internally.
</Callout>

## Integration at a glance

- Backend (server-only): `POST /api/loan-journeys/session` calls the platform `POST /api/lab/sessions` with `Authorization: Bearer sk_*` and returns `embedUrl`.
- Frontend (client): calls your backend and renders `<iframe src={embedUrl}>`.

<Callout type="warning" title="Allowlist required">
Your embed domain must be allow-listed per application (`embed_domains`), or the iframe will be blocked by CSP `frame-ancestors`.
</Callout>

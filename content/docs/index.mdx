## The Problem & The Solution

Embedding credit into a product isn’t a single API call. It is typically a **multi-step journey** with asynchronous outcomes, brand requirements, security constraints, and production-grade reliability needs.

The Aarthik Credit SDK is built to standardize the hard parts:

* A **single client** with consistent configuration: auth, tenancy, retries, timeouts, correlation IDs
* A **predictable response and error model** for clean UI and platform observability
* Optional **UI building blocks** designed to look native inside your app (white-label theming)
* A **journey orchestration layer** (workflows) to manage multi-step user flows reliably

This document focuses strictly on **SDK integration mechanics**—not underlying business rules, partner policy, or platform protocol details.

description: Learn how to integrate your app with Journeys.

## How your app integrates with journeys (two modes)

### Mode A: UI kit renders screens (fastest)

Your app embeds a single component; SDK handles screen selection and transitions.

```tsx
<CreditProvider client={credit} tenantID="tenant_acme">
  <CreditJourney />
</CreditProvider>
```

**Best for:** fastest go-to-market, consistent UX patterns, minimal custom UI.

---

### Mode B: headless journey + your UI (max customization)

Your app controls rendering; the SDK gives you a journey handle and state updates.

```ts
// Draft API sketch (shape may evolve)
const journey = await credit.journeys.start({
  tenantID: "tenant_acme",
  // optional: initial user context or prefilled inputs
});

// Subscribe to state updates and render your own UI
journey.subscribe((snapshot) => {
  console.log("Journey state:", snapshot.state, snapshot.correlationID);
});

// User selects an offer
journey.send({ type: "SELECT_OFFER", offerID: "offer_123" });
```

**Best for:** full UI control, existing design systems, custom funnels.

This is the part that typically determines whether an integration stays clean at scale.

A **journey** is the SDK’s orchestration unit for end-to-end credit flows. It’s designed so that your app can:

* start a journey (new user session)
* display the right screen at the right time
* submit user input safely (idempotency + retries)
* handle asynchronous updates without fragile glue code
* resume progress after refresh/restart

## Journey lifecycle (what your users experience)

A typical journey looks like:

1. **Start** the flow from your product context (e.g., “Apply for credit”)
2. **Discover** available options (offer discovery)
3. **Select** a preferred option
4. **Provide details** (forms / consents / uploads, as required)
5. **Submit** and wait for asynchronous processing
6. **Track** progress and outcomes
7. **Complete** (success) or **end** (decline/cancel)

The SDK turns this into a clean integration surface: your UI reacts to a single state stream, instead of juggling multiple independent network calls and partial flags.
